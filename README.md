# Multiprogramming-OS-Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a multiprogramming operating system.(Phase 1 & Phase 2)

## Overview

The project demonstrates the functionality of a multiprogramming OS through various phases. The simulation is implemented in C++ and covers key concepts of operating systems such as process scheduling, memory management, and resource allocation.

## Features

- **Process Scheduling:** Implements various scheduling algorithms.
- **Memory Management:** Simulates allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Resource Management:** Manages different system resources efficiently.

## Getting Started
